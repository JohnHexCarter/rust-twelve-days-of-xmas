# Twelve Days of Christmas

This is just a generator to pump out the lyrics to the Twelve Days of Christmas.
This is the "homework" from [The Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).

I def don't understand the "owned" element to converting strings from an array to strings in a concatenated
string, as I was just following the suggestions from the compiler, but that's the next chapter, so I'll be
sure to get a better understanding and possibly revisit this.
